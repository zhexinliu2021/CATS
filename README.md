# Classification Assessment of Tumor Subtypes
26 March 2018

In this group assignment, you need to train a classifier that is able to predict subtypes of breast cancer tumors based on array CGH (aCGH) data.

## Background
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and classification of breast cancer tumors in their molecular subtypes has important implications for the treatment and prognosis. Three receptors play a pivotal role in these subtypes: the Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR) and Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2). After removal of the tumor, the pathology department of the hospital tests these samples for presence of ER, PR and HER2. The three main subtypes in breast cancer on which the treatment decision will be based are:
* HER2 positive: HER2+
* Hormone receptor positive (HR+): ER+ and/or PR+, and HER2-
* Triple negative (TN): ER-, PR- and HER2-
Each of the three subtypes reacts differently to different types of treatment.

## Data
We provide you with a dataset with 100 breast cancer samples from the three subtypes. These samples are analyzed on a high-resolution array CGH platform with 244,000 probes per array that measures the quantity of chromosomal DNA. The pre-processing of the data has been done for you.
For each of these regions and each sample we give the call whether that region is a gain, an amplification, a loss or normal (-1 for loss, 0 for normal, 1 for gain, and 2 for amplification of the DNA). Two files are provided, one containing the preprocessed aCGH data of the cancer samples (Train_call.txt) and the other containing the associated clinical outcome of these samples â€” the subtypes (Train_clinical.txt).


## Building your classifier
Your task is to get a well-trained classifier for predicting the three breast cancer subtypes. To achieve this, you might need some of the following steps.
1. Data purification, transformation, if necessary.
2. Feature selection, if necessary.
3. Choose machine learning methods (classifiers).
4. Train and validate the classifiers.

## Classifier Assessment
In order to test how well your classifier performs you will be given another 57 samples for which you will need to predict their subtypes (HER2+, TN or HR+). These samples will be given to you towards the end of the assignment. In addition, you will need to estimate how many samples you classified correctly, which means you need a good benchmarking scheme to support your estimate.
To make it clear here, you need to submit
1) the predicted labels for each of the samples (you need to follow the file format on Canvas) and
2) an estimate for the number of correctly labeled samples (out of 57).
